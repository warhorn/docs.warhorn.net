# Contributing to Warhorn Docs

Thanks for considering contributing to the Warhorn user documentation site!

I (@bcm) love to receive contributions from the community, from typo corrections to writing whole new docs from scratch. Every contribution makes it that much easier for somebody to find or run a game.

When you follow the guidelines in this document, you help make it possible for me to manage this open source project effectively. In return, I promise to address your issue in a timely fashion and give you actionable feedback on your pull request.

Please note that this repository and its tools are only for the Warhorn user documentation. **Do not use the issue tracker for Warhorn support questions.** You can get usage help by emailing [info@warhorn.net](info@warhorn.net). I will close any issue asking general questions about how to use Warhorn.
